# hptx

Transfer files between HP Saturn calculators (HP48 S/SX/G/GX, HP49G, and
later HP38G/39G/40G) and a modern computer over a serial cable, from macOS,
Windows and Linux. Kermit and XModem, a sans-IO Rust core, a CLI that works
for people and for AI agents, and a GUI later.

Status: planning. See `PLAN.md`. The `emulator/` directory already holds a
Docker container running the real calculator ROMs in the saturnng emulator
with the serial port on TCP, which is what the tests talk to.

Not affiliated with HP. HP, HP48 and HP49 are trademarks of HP Inc.
HP's calculator ROMs are not included; the emulator container downloads them
from hpcalc.org at build time for local use only.
